                <p>As a Marketing Coordinator at Synergy Infoconnect, I was tasked with being their webmaster. 
                    In this role, I was in charge of all functions relating to their website. 
                    From competitor and topic research to content creation, from design to SEO, I implemented everything.
                    Through this role, I was able to open my eyes to the intricacies and BTS of digital branding.
                    In fact, this is what sparked my interest in HTML, CSS, and Javascript coding.</p>
