Hello, <br>
This is a portfolio of my experience working with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This will include professional and personal projects. <br>
My hope for this site is to show off how my work has progressed over time. Eventually I hope to create a project that people will find fun or useful in whatever they choose to do. <br>
Please do not copy or take my work. It is not good and it probably won't be too good. <br>
Thank you, <br>
Jason T.
