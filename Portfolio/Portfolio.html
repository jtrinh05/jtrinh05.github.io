                    <p>I have been a Marketing Coordinator for over 4 years. I specialize
                        in digital marketing through SEO, social media management, and webmaster roles. As a way
                        to test my experience, I decided to create this website without the use of website
                        creation aides or any premade layouts. <br>
                        I thrive in an environment where I can learn new skills and have a chance to utilize them.
                        I hope to work with you in the future and push each other to new heights.

                            In this role, I was in charge of all functions relating to their website. 
                            From competitor and topic research to content creation, from design to SEO, I implemented everything.
                            Through this role, I was able to open my eyes to the intricacies and BTS of digital branding.
                            In fact, this is what sparked my interest in HTML, CSS, and Javascript coding.</p>
