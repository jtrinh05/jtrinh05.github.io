                      Hi, I'm Jasonâ€”a marketing coordinator with over 4 years of marketing experience across digital
                      and physical spectrums. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I specialize in digital avenues, creating informational content on websites and drafting advertising
                      campaigns on Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google. As for marketing in a physical landscape, I have interacted with
                      our consumers in helping them transition to our software through on-site teaching and data transfer assistance.
                      While working, I focus on clear collaboration and adaptable reactions, able to quickly shift focus
                      to the more vital task. In a solo-oriented situation, I am use to thinking independently and taking
                      initiative in my work.

                      SEO isn't only about increasing your search rankings, it's also about enhancing the user experience 
                      for your website. That includes faster load times for your photos and information, improved color distinction
                      between foreground and background, and overall maintenance of your website. All of these parts come together
                      to create something subtle that users enjoy and will increase the chances of them coming back. This occurence
                      makes your website optimized.

                      Each of the websites I have worked on has been created with coding aides, but with just a couple lines of customized 
                      lines I was able to create coherent pages that garnered visitor attention and tripled visitors since before I joined the team.

                      The healthcare industry is a growing industry with stagnant practices. When physicians or 
                      practices are use to using a software, they are rigid in their ways and will continue using said software
                      unless a much better alternative is made. Each software has different features, but what makes it stand out?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As I met with physicians and their front desk team, I got a clear understanding of challenges that they 
                      faced when using competitor programs. This resulted in me providing input on potential shortcuts or 
                      streamlined processes for our developers to create. My interactions with the development 
                      team became so common that I became a software tester to help them find any bugs in the system or improvements
                      in the natural workflow for physicians and other members of the care team.

                      It is important to make sure that the message you want to share is synonymous with your brand or synonymous
                      with where you want your brand to be. With Synergy Infoconnect, they provide healthcare analytics software that
                      helps doctors track the entire care taking process and how patients are improving, and consistently reminding patients
                      to schedule yearly, or monthly, appointments. By having patients schedule regular check-ups, doctors are able to accurately
                      track illnesses and quickly treat symptoms.

                    <p>
                      With this in mind, I created marketing campaigns for "national awareness month" social media posts. 
                      This was to highlight any diseases or chronic illnesses that could affect people and then remind them
                      to schedule an appointment with their doctors. I also included website links to our partnering doctors
                      if anyone didn't have a primary care physician. These monthly campaigns increased website visitors by 135% and
                      increased our partnering practice's online interaction by 120%.

                      Understanding where your brand stands is the number one thing to know when plotting out where to go.
                      Even if you want your brand to go somewhere, you need to know what to aim for. Being able to analyze the market 
                      and research topics or processes for Synergy Infoconnect has helped me in creating informational and technically correct
                      landing pages and social media campaigns.

                      By sifting through dozens of competitor pages, I was able to compile data on their consumers'
                      sentiment and identify painpoints that they were missing from their messaging. I was able to 
                      position Synergy in front of these competitors by addressing the exact issues within our own webpages,
                      causing us to appear higher on Google Search Results. This allowed me to attract new clients and increase our potential leads.

                  As a Marketing Coordinator at Synergy Infoconnect, I was tasked with being their webmaster.
                  In this role, I was in charge of all functions relating to their website.
                  From competitor and topic research to content creation, from design to SEO, I implemented everything.
                  Through this role, I was able to open my eyes to the intricacies and BTS of digital branding.
                  In fact, this is what sparked my interest in HTML, CSS, and Javascript coding.

                  While working at Synergy Infoconnect, I also monitored our clients' webpages.
                  Our commitment to helping our clients succeed in their business allowed us to capture more earnings and foster strong customer relations.
                  As the moderator of their website, I was essentially part of their workforce too. 
                  If I wasn't helping the front desk with patients scheduling appointments through their contact form, I was researching and 
                  writing new posts about relevant medical topics such as: vaccination reminders, annual check-up appointments, or Medicare
                  Enrollment periods.

                  One of Synergy Infoconnect's clients wanted to create a new health plan company to bring healthcare to
                  people that aren't able to access it. Because of the strong relationship between Synergy and the client,
                  I was asked to create a website framework for when they are able to fully create their health plans. 
                  I took inspiration from multiple healthcare/health plan websites in order to create this one.
